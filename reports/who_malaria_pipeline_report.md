**QUICK SUMMARY: GREEN (Manage at Community Level)**

• What I see: Routine evidence retrieval from national guidelines
• What to do: Follow advice below, monitor for changes
• What NOT to do: Do NOT give medicine at home for danger signs

**WHAT TO DO (step by step):**

**Step 1:** Assess patient carefully
**Step 2:** Check for danger signs (see below)
**Step 3:** If unsure, refer to health facility
**Step 4:** Record all findings

**MONITORING:**

• Check if patient can drink normally
• Watch for convulsions or shaking
• Monitor breathing – is it fast or difficult?
• Check if patient is awake and alert
• Look for pale or yellow skin/eyes

**DANGER SIGNS - STOP AND REFER IF YOU SEE:**

• Cannot drink or breastfeed
• Very weak, cannot sit up or wake up
• Shaking/fitting (convulsions)
• Vomiting everything
• Difficulty breathing
• Pale or yellow skin/eyes
• Bleeding from any place

**WHAT TO TELL THE FAMILY:**

The symptoms can be managed at home with guidance. Follow the advice you were given. Come back if symptoms get worse.

**REMEMBER AS A VHT:**

• Always check for danger signs first
• If you are unsure, it is better to refer
• Record all patients you see
• Keep your VHT kit and referral forms ready

### Feasibility

Feasibility

One consideration in determining the feasibility of the recommendation on treatment of malaria in

the first trimester is that the existing warning against the use of artemisinin in the first trimester

implies the need to consistently screen for pregnancy among all women of childbearing potential

prior to treatment for malaria. However, pregnancy screening is rarely done prior to initiating

malaria treatment. As observed by national programmes, the contraindicati...

In considering the acceptability of artemether-lumefantrine versus quinine treatments, the GDG

looked to how quinine is presently being used and accepted.

Adherence to quinine is low because it is frequently associated with adverse effects, including

cinchonism, nausea and hypoglycaemia [231][243][244]. In a review of 35 national guidelines,

66% recommended oral quinine as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in the first

Mortality from untreated severe malaria (particularly cerebral malaria) approaches 100%. With prompt, effective antimalarial

treatment and supportive care, the rate falls to 10–20% overall. Within the broad definition of severe malaria some syndromes are

**Question:** Monitoring after antimalarial treatment failure

### 1. Therapeutic efficacy

### Therapeutic efficacy

Therapeutic efficacy

Monitoring of therapeutic efficacy in falciparum malaria involves assessing clinical and parasitological outcomes of treatment

for at least 28 days after the start of adequate treatment and monitoring for the reappearance of parasites in blood. The exact

duration of post-treatment follow-up is based on the elimination half- life of the partner drug in the ACT being evaluated. Tools

for monitoring antimalaria drug efficacy can be found on the WHO...

The benefit of parasitological diagnosis relies entirely on an appropriate management response of health care providers. The two

detect parasite-specific antigens or enzymes that are either genus or species specific.

Both microscopy and RDTs must be supported by a quality assurance programme. Antimalarial trea...

Individual patients derive the maximum benefit from an ACT if they can access it within 24–48 h of the onset of malaria symptoms.

6. Interventions in the final phase of elimination and prevention of re-establishment

The Global technical strategy for malaria 2016-2030 [4] urges all malaria-endemic countries to accelerate towards elimination and

attainment of malaria-free status. WHO recommends that all countries ensure access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment as

part of universal health coverage; recommendations relate...

Scope

The consolidated WHO Guidelines for malaria bring together all recommendations for malaria, including prevention using vector control,

preventive chemotherapy and the vaccine; diagnosis, treatment and elimination strategies. The Guidelines also provide links to other

resources including unpublished evidence reviewed at the time of formulating recommendations, guidance and information on strategic

use of information to drive impact, surveillance, monitoring and evaluation, op...

MDA to reduce transmission of P. vivax (2022)

In areas with P. vivax transmission, antimalarial medicine can be given as chemoprevention through mass drug administration

(MDA) to reduce transmission.

•

MDA may quickly reduce transmission of P. vivax, but the effect wanes within 1–3 months. Therefore, if MDA is

implemented, it should be one of several components of a robust malaria elimination programme (including, at minimum,

good coverage of case-based surveillance with parasi...

problem-solving approach using local data to identify recommendations that are relevant at a country level and based on local

context, defining stratum-specific packages of interventions that optimize impact and are prioritized for resource allocation. This shift

moves away from overly prescriptive recommendations and will clearly distinguish evidence-informed recommendations from contextual

considerations. The con...
