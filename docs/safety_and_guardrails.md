# Safety and Guardrails

This document describes the safety measures implemented across every stage of the pipeline. Medical Q&A systems can cause real harm if they deliver incorrect dosing, miss danger signs, or present unverified information as authoritative. Our approach is defense-in-depth: multiple independent safety layers, each catching different categories of error.

## Safety by pipeline stage

### Stage 1: Extraction safety

**Preservation of exact values.** The extraction engine uses rule-based parsing (PyMuPDF + pdfplumber), never LLM-based interpretation. Cell values in dosing tables are preserved character-for-character. This eliminates the risk of an AI model "correcting" a dose that looks unusual but is clinically correct.

**Cross-validation (Pass 4).** Every page of extracted text is independently re-extracted with a second library (pdfplumber) and compared. Pages with <90% consistency are flagged, alerting downstream stages to potential extraction errors.

**Automatic PDF repair (2026-04-10).** Some PDFs produced by tools like Adobe InDesign use a non-standard internal page-tree structure that pdfminer/pdfplumber cannot traverse, causing pdfplumber to return 0 pages and the cross-consistency score to silently stay at 0% — a false failure. The extractor now detects this: if pdfplumber returns 0 pages, it automatically re-saves the PDF through PyMuPDF (`garbage=4, deflate=True, clean=True`) to a temporary file, which normalises the PDF structure to standard format. pdfplumber then runs on the repaired copy and produces correct results. The temporary file is deleted after cross-validation. This fix is transparent — no configuration change is needed — and makes cross-validation work correctly on any uploaded PDF.

**Table classification.** Tables are classified by clinical function (dosing, clinical management, evidence, structural, other). Misclassifying a dosing table as "other" could cause it to be paraphrased instead of preserved verbatim. The classification uses conservative keyword matching with domain-specific vocabularies from `configs/*.json`.

### Stage 2: Validation safety

Six independent validation stages catch different error categories:

| Stage | What it checks | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Structure | Heading hierarchy, page numbering | Malformed structure = wrong section assignments |
| Tables | Column counts, numeric density | Corrupted tables = wrong dosing data |
| Cross-consistency | PyMuPDF vs pdfplumber agreement | Extraction failures = missing content |
| Medical content | Presence of critical clinical terms | Missing terms = incomplete extraction |
| Dosing plausibility | Weight bands, monotonicity, coverage, clinical bounds, combination ratios, empty cells | Implausible dosing = medication errors |
| Human review | Flags items needing physician attention | Catches what automated checks cannot |

**Dosing plausibility** is the most critical safety stage. It runs six sub-checks on every dosing-classified table:

1. **Weight contiguity** — no gaps between consecutive weight bands
2. **Dose monotonicity** — doses increase with weight (as expected clinically)
3. **Weight coverage** — table covers pediatric through adult ranges
4. **Clinical bounds** — per-kg doses fall within reference ranges for known drugs
5. **Combination consistency** — fixed-ratio drug combinations maintain stable ratios
6. **Positive/non-empty** — no missing values in dosing cells

### Stage 3: Chunking safety

**Preservation levels.** Every chunk is assigned a preservation level (`VERBATIM`, `HIGH`, `STANDARD`) based on its section type and table presence. This level travels with the chunk through retrieval and response generation, constraining how the content may be used.

**Metadata extraction.** Clinical metadata (drug names, weight ranges, contraindications) is extracted from every chunk. This enables the retriever and response layer to make safety-aware decisions — e.g., including contraindication chunks when a drug is mentioned.

**Related chunk linking.** Dosing tables are linked to their surrounding narrative context. When a dosing table is retrieved, the related narrative (which may contain contraindications or special population warnings) can be pulled in automatically.

### Stage 4: Clinical verification

**Physician review package.** The `ClinicalVerifier` generates a structured review package (`review_package.json` + `physician_review_report.md`) that a clinician can review before the knowledge base is used for patient care.

**5-tier triage classification:**

| Tier | Content type | Review priority |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Validated dosing tables (passed Stage 2) | Mandatory — highest priority |
| 2 | Unvalidated dosing tables | Mandatory |
| 3 | Clinical management content | Mandatory |
| 4 | Evidence tables, high-preservation narrative | Recommended |
| 5 | Optional/background content | Optional |

**5 clinical verification checks per chunk:**

1. Dosage accuracy
2. Patient stratification correctness
3. Contraindication completeness
4. Conditional logic integrity
5. Source provenance

**SHA-256 audit hashes.** Every chunk gets a content hash. After physician review, the hash is re-verified to ensure no content was modified between review and deployment.

**Digital signatures.** Completed reviews include a digital signature (reviewer name, institution, timestamp, chunk ID, audit hash) for accountability.

**Deployment gate.** `passes_deployment_gate()` blocks any knowledge base from production use if mandatory-tier chunks (Tiers 1-3) have not been verified. This is a hard gate — there is no override.

### Stage 5: Response safety

**Two-brain architecture.** The response generator and the guardrail validator are separate, independent systems. The generator cannot suppress or modify guardrail findings.

**Guardrail checks (updated 2026-04-10):**
- Triage level must match danger signs detected in query + retrieved chunk metadata
- Dangerous advice patterns are regex-detected and blocked (10 patterns)
- All five required sections must be present with meaningful content
- Citations must reference real pages in the knowledge base
- Dosing values in the response must appear verbatim in at least one retrieved source chunk
- Drug contraindications from chunk metadata are cross-checked against patient context in the query

**Guardrail improvements (2026-04-10):** Five new checks added to `MedicalGuardrailBrain`:

1. **Triage validation from evidence** — `_collect_danger_signs()` scans query text and `clinical_metadata.danger_signs` from retrieved chunks (not raw chunk text, which is too noisy). If danger signs are found and the response is not RED, the check fails. `validate_response()` now accepts `retrieved_chunks` as an optional parameter — both call sites in `orchestrator.py` pass the retrieved chunks.

2. **Expanded dangerous advice patterns** — 4 → 10 patterns. New: double-dosing, stopping treatment course early, dosing without weight check, home treatment for emergencies, metronidazole in first trimester, ibuprofen in infants.

3. **Dosing value grounding** — `_validate_dosing_values()`: every dosing quantity in the response (mg, ml, mcg, etc.) is checked against the verbatim text and table markdown of all retrieved source chunks. A value absent from all chunks is flagged — it may have been paraphrased or invented.

4. **Contraindication cross-check** — `_check_contraindications()`: patient-context signals in the query (pregnant, infant, renal, liver, breastfeeding) are matched against `contraindications` in retrieved chunk `clinical_metadata`. Any contraindication that applies to the detected patient context raises a warning.

5. **Section completeness** — `_check_completeness()`: required sections must contain content above minimum character thresholds (not just a bare header). Citations section must include at least one page reference.

**Preservation-level enforcement.** VERBATIM content (dosing tables) is rendered exactly as extracted — the response formatter cannot paraphrase or summarize it.

**Confidence scoring (updated 2026-04-09).** Every response includes a numeric confidence (0.0–1.0) computed from three real retrieval signals:

```
confidence = 0.6 × retrieval_score + 0.4 × coverage − penalty
```

- **Retrieval score (60%)** — mean score of the top-3 retrieved chunks, normalized to [0,1] after RRF + cross-encoder blending
- **Coverage (40%)** — fraction of the 5 requested chunks that were actually returned
- **Guardrail penalty (subtracted)** — −0.05 per warning, −0.15 per error, −0.10 if guardrail failed

Prior to this change, the score was a hardcoded constant (0.90 for all non-RED queries) adjusted only for guardrail warnings — meaning a query backed by weak evidence received the same score as one with five highly-relevant passages. The score now carries real information about how well the retrieved evidence supports the response.

No single layer is relied upon exclusively. Each layer catches different failure modes, and the deployment gate ensures that unverified content cannot reach patients.
